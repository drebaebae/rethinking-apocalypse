    <b>This is the Indigenous anti-future.</b>
    We are not concerned with how our enemies name their dead world or how they
    recognize or acknowledge us or these lands. We are not concerned with
    re-working their ways of managing control or honoring their dead agreements
    or treaties. They will not be compelled to end the destruction that their
    world is predicated upon. We do not plead with them to end global warming,
    as it is the conclusion of their apocalyptic imperative and their life is
    built upon the death of Mother Earth.
    <br>
      We bury the right wing and the left wing together in the earth they are so
      hungry to consume.
    </b>
    The conclusion of the ideological war of colonial politics is that
    Indigenous Peoples always lose, unless we lose ourselves. Capitalists and
    colonizers will not lead us out of their dead futures. Apocalyptic
    idealization is a self fulfilling prophecy. It is the linear world ending
    from within. Apocalyptic logic exists within a spiritual, mental, and
    emotional dead zone that also cannibalizes itself. It is the dead risen to
    consume all life.
    <b>Our world lives when their world ceases to exist.</b>
    As Indigenous anti-futurists, we are the consequence of the history of the
    colonizers future. We are the consequence of their war against Mother Earth.
    We will not allow the specter of the colonizer, the ghosts of the past to
    haunt the ruins of this world. We are the actualization of our
    prophecies.This is the re-emergence of the world of cycles. This is our
    ceremony.Between silent skies. The world breathes again and the fever
    subsides.
    <b>The land is quiet. Waiting for us to listen.</b>
    When there are less distractions, we go to the place where our ancestors
    emerged.And their/our voice.
    <b>
      There is a song older than worlds here, it heals deeper then the
      colonizers blade could ever cut.
    </b>
    And there, our voice. We were always healers. This is the first medicine.
    Colonialism is a plague, capitalism is pandemic.These systems are anti-life,
    they will not be compelled to cure themselves.We will not allow these
    corrupted sickened systems to recuperate. We will spread.
    <b>We are the antibodies.</b>
