    Our ancestors dreamt against the end of the world.
    <br<br>
    Many worlds have gone before this one. Our traditional histories are tightly
    woven with the fabric of the birthing and ending of worlds. Through these
    cataclysms we have gained many lessons that have shaped who we are and how
    we are to be with one another. Our ways of being are informed through
    finding harmony through and from the destruction of worlds. The Elliptic.
    Birth. Death. Rebirth.
    <br />
    <br />
    We have an unknowing of histories upon histories of the world that is part
    of us. It is the language of the cosmos, it speaks in prophecies long carved
    in the scars where our ancestors dreamed. It is the ghostdance, the seven
    fires, the birth of the White Buffalo, the seventh generation, it is the
    five suns, it is written in stone near Oraibi, and beyond. These prophecies
    are not just predictive, they have also been diagnostic and instructive.
    <br />
    <br />
    We are the dreamers dreamt by our ancestors. We have traversed all time
    between the breaths of our dreams. We exist at once with our ancestors and
    unbirthed generations. Our future is held in our hands. It is our mutuality
    and interdependence. It is our relative. It is in the creases of our
    memories, folded gently by our ancestors. It is our collective Dreamtime,
    and it is Now. Then. Tomorrow. Yesterday.
    <br />
    <br />
    The anti-colonial imagination isnâ€™t a subjective reaction to colonial
    futurisms, it is anti-settler future. Our life cycles are not linear, our
    future exists without time. It is a dream, uncolonized.
