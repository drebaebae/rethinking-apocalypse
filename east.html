    “The end is near. Or has it come and gone before?”
    <i>an ancestor</i>
    Why can we imagine the ending of the world, yet not the ending of
    colonialism?
    <br />
    <br />
    We live the future of a past that is not our own. It is a history of utopian
    fantasies and apocalyptic idealization.It is a pathogenic global social
    order of imagined futures, built upon genocide, enslavement, ecocide, and
    total ruination. What conclusions are to be realized in a world constructed
    of bones and empty metaphors? A world of fetishized endings calculated
    amidst the collective fiction of virulent specters. From religious tomes to
    fictionalized scientific entertainment, each imagined timeline constructed
    so predictably; beginning, middle, and ultimately, The End. Inevitably in
    this narrative theres a protagonist fighting an Enemy Other (a generic
    appropriation of African/Haitian spirituality, a “zombie”?), and spoiler
    alert: its not you or me. So many are eagerly ready to be the lone survivors
    of the “zombie apocalypse.”
    <br />
    <br />
    But these are interchangeable metaphors, this zombie/Other, this
    apocalypse.These empty metaphors, this linearity, only exist within the
    language of nightmares, they are at once part of the apocalyptic imagination
    and impulse.This way of “living,” or “culture,” is one of domination that
    consumes all for its own benefit. It is an economic and political reordering
    to fit a reality resting on pillars of competition, ownership, and control
    in pursuit of profit and permanent exploitation. It professes “freedom” yet
    its foundation is set on lands stolen while its very structure is built by
    stolen lives.
    <br />
    <br />
    It is this very “culture” that must always have an Enemy Other, to lay
    blame, to lay claim, to affront, enslave and murder. A subhuman enemy that
    any and all forms of extreme violence are not only permitted but expected to
    be put upon. If it doesnt have an immediate Other, it meticulously
    constructs one. This Other is not made from fear but its destruction is
    compelled by it. This Other is constituted from apocalyptic axioms and
    permanent misery. This Othering, this weitko disease, is perhaps best
    symptomatized in its simplest stratagem, in that of our silenced remakening:
    <br />
    <br />
    <i>
      They are dirty, They are unsuited for life, They are unable, They are
      incapable, They are disposable, They are non-believers, They are unworthy,
      They are made to benefit us, They hate our freedom, They are undocumented,
      They are queer, They are black, They are Indigenous, They are less than,
      They are against us, until finally, They are no more.
    </i>
    <br />
    <br />
    In this constant mantra of violence reframed, its either You or its Them. It
    is the Other who is sacrificed for an immortal and cancerous continuity. It
    is the Other who is poisoned, who is bombed, who is left quietly beneath the
    rubble.
    <br />
    <br />
    This way of unbeing, which has infected all aspects of our lives, which is
    responsible for the annihilation of entire species, the toxification of
    oceans, air and earth, the clear-cutting and burning of whole forests, mass
    incarceration, the technological possibility of world ending warfare, and
    raising the temperatures on a global scale, this is the deadly politics of
    capitalism, its pandemic.
