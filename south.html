    <b>An ending that has come before.</b>
    The physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual invasion of our lands,
    bodies, and minds to settle and to exploit, is colonialism. Ships sailed on
    poisoned winds and bloodied tides across oceans pushed with a shallow breath
    and impulse to bondage, millions upon millions of lives were quietly
    extinguished before they could name their enemy.
    <b>1492. 1918. 2020…</b>
    Biowarfare blankets, the slaughter of our relative the buffalo, the damming
    of lifegiving rivers, the scorching of untarnished earth, the forced
    marches, the treatied imprisonment, coercive education through abuse and
    violence. The day to day post-war, post-genocide, trading post-colonial
    humiliation of our slow mass suicide on the altar of capitalism; work,
    income, pay rent, drink, fuck, breed, retire, die. Its on the roadside, its
    on sale at Indian markets, serving drinks at the casino, restocking Bashas,
    its nice Indians behind, you. These are the gifts of infesting manifest
    destinies, this is that futured imaginary our captors would have us
    perpetuate and be a part. The merciless imposition of this dead world was
    driven by an idealized utopia as Charnel House, it was “for our own good” an
    act of “civilization.” Killing the “Indian”; killing our past and with it
    our future. “Saving the man”; imposing another past and with it another
    future. These are the apocalyptic ideals of abusers, racists and
    hetero-patriarchs. The doctrinal blind faith of those who can only see life
    through a prism, a fractured kaleidoscope of an endless and total war. Its
    an apocalyptic that colonizes our imaginations and
    <b>destroys our past and future simultaneously.</b>
    It is a struggle to dominate human meaning and all existence. This is the
    futurism of the colonizer, the capitalist. It is at once every future ever
    stolen by the plunderer, the warmonger and the rapist. This has always been
    about existence and non-existence. It is apocalypse, actualized. And with
    the only certainty being a deathly end, colonialism is a plague.
    <b>
      Our ancestors understood that this way of being could not be reasoned or
      negotiated with.
    </b>
    That it could not be mitigated or redeemed. They understood that the
    apocalyptic only exists in absolutes.
